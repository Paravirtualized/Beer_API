    // we decrement that delay until it reaches 0, we do not allow the vgm data reader to progress to the next byte if this
    // delay counter is not 0.  Command 63 is a shortcut for a delay of 1/50th of a second
    // Command 50, means the next byte is to be sent directly to the sound chip, so thats exactly what we do :-)
